## Features

- **Remote Monitoring**: Constantly monitor the baby via sensors.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts on your mobile device if the baby wakes up, cries, or wets the bed.
- **Automated Rocking**: Side-to-side rocking motion to soothe the baby using a geared motor system.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Check temperature and humidity around the cradle.
- **Live Video Streaming**: View live video feed from the cradle's camera.
- **Cloud Storage**: Store and analyze data in real-time using Firebase.

## Components

- **Arduino Uno**: Microcontroller for managing sensors and motors.
- **Raspberry Pi**: For handling the camera and data processing.
- **Sound Sensor**: Detects babyâ€™s cries.
- **Water Sensor**: Detects moisture indicating a wet diaper.
- **DHT11**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **Pi Camera**: Captures live video feed.
- **Servo Motor**: Controls the rocking motion.
- **Power Supply Module**: Powers all the components.

## Setup

1. **Arduino Uno**: Connect sensors and servo motor.
2. **Raspberry Pi**: Set up Pi Camera and connect to the Arduino.
3. **Sensors**: Attach sound, water, and DHT11 sensors to the Arduino.
4. **Power Supply**: Ensure a stable power source for all components.
5. **Mobile App**: Install the companion app on your mobile device to receive notifications and monitor data.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riy4z/smart-cradle.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd smart-cradle
    ```

3. Set up the Arduino:
    - Upload the Arduino code from `smart_cradle/` directory to your Arduino Uno using Arduino IDE.

4. Set up the Raspberry Pi:
    - Run python script `cradle.py` in `Raspberry Pi Code/` directory to run the flask application and camera script.
    - Dependencies for python are cv2, serial, firebase_admin, pygame, flask
    - Run python script `main.py` in  `Cry Detection (ML)/` directory to run the Real Time Cry Detection Model.

5. Configure the mobile app:
    -  Navigate to the `BabyMonitoringApp/` directory to set up and configure the mobile application.
    -  Use `npm i` to install all the dependencies required for the react native application.
    -  Then use the command `npx expo start` to run the React Native Application
    -  Use Virtual Emulator or Expo go app from playstore to use the mobile application.
      
## Usage

1. Place the baby in the cradle.
2. Ensure all sensors and components are properly connected.
3. Use the mobile app to monitor real-time data and receive alerts.
4. Adjust cradle settings via the mobile app as needed.
